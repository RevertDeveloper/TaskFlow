- TF-0402: selectors and module-level authenticated permissions
- TF-0208: API multi-tenant isolation tests

## In Progress
- Phase 4.1 is complete; Phase 4.2 contract work is next.

## Blockers
- `mypy` is not installed in the available API virtual environment.
- Real Accounts staging smoke is deferred to Phase 16 and is not a development blocker.

## Decisions
- Use Accounts session-based identity as the canonical source of identity
- Keep TaskFlow as a modular monolith
- Keep browser and API topology same-origin with TaskFlow as the authorized gateway to Accounts
- Add no JWT/OAuth or duplicate password system unless a separate approved ADR changes this decision

## Last Quality Gate
Phase 3 PASS. 55 API tests, domain ownership and transaction tests, migration
up/down evidence, Ruff, Django check and migration drift check pass. Real
Accounts staging auth remains deferred to Phase 16.

## Last Commit
Pending commit for Phase 4.1 API surface and isolation

## Next Task
Implement TF-0403: define response/error envelopes and the OpenAPI/schema contract.

## In Progress
- None. Phase 5 is complete and Phase 6 is next.

## Blockers
- `mypy` is not installed in the available API virtual environment.
- Real Accounts staging smoke is deferred to Phase 16 and is not a development blocker.

## Decisions
- Use Accounts session-based identity as the canonical source of identity
- Keep TaskFlow as a modular monolith
- Keep browser and API topology same-origin with TaskFlow as the authorized gateway to Accounts
- Add no JWT/OAuth or duplicate password system unless a separate approved ADR changes this decision

## Last Quality Gate
Phase 5 PASS. Web lint, strict typecheck, production build and 12 Vitest tests
pass. Visual QA completed at 375, 768 and 1440 px. Real Accounts staging auth
remains deferred to Phase 16.

## Last Commit
`feat(web): complete frontend foundation and design system` (Phase 5)

## Next Task
Implement TF-0601: create frontend use-case ports and UI state.
